# penny-pi

a raspberry pi machine learning project that's self driving and loves cats :)

---

this project is pretty small, and has messy code, but currently i'm using an L298N + a raspberry pi 2 with a random car chasis.

the final goal is to have it be completley self driving along a track, and using `tflite`, once it sees a cat, it'll stop and wait for the cat to go.
